Here is what i learned from this Web Page project


when using linear-gradient, better set the body height to 100vh and width to 100%
why? because the body is not the root element (<html> is the root element) so its height and width , in some cases may not be set to 100%, which 
can cause a bad linear-gradient


Better use <nav> inside a <header>.


wrap the content (image , h1 , h2 , text , buttons..) inside a section



Some convenient font-sizes:
    logo:28px
    menu a:16px
    login/signup:16px
    big title content(title in center):40px

some Convenient Paddings:
    navbar:20px 15px
    a buttons:10px 20ox / 12px 24px

Some convenient margins:
    between a menu:35px
    between buttons:15px..30px
